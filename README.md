An 8085 emulator with the undocumented instructions and flags

## Caution
This is a work in progress so some flag emulation and other details may well
be incorrect. In particular I know DAA is wrong.

## Why Another 8085 Emulator

Because every other open 8085 emulator I could find on a quick search was at
best an 8080 emulator with the timings tweaked and RIM/SIM added not an
actual 8085 emulation including the new flags and instructions that Intel
decided not to document but which are well known and used.
