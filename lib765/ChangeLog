	* Forked the lib765 code for V85 and ripped out all of the GNU
	  autocrap so it's easy to build wherever we need it.

2010-06-28 John Elliott

	* Updated the configure scripts to more recent autotools.

2009-01-12 John Elliott

	* lib765-0.4.2 released.

	* Increased the size of fdc_exec_buf. Since multisector reads have
	 been added, it needs to hold a whole track.

2007-06-11 John Elliott

	* lib765-0.4.1 released.

	* Removed spurious reference to LIBDSK_EXPOSES_DIRTY.

2007-04-15 John Elliott

	* lib765-0.4.0 released.

	* Add basic support for multisector reads (no multisector writes yet).
	 This should allow Speedlock protection to work.

2006-03-29 John Elliott

	* Don't segfault if fdc_get_st3() is called on a nonexistent drive 
	 (Mike Wynne)

2005-02-19 Philip Kendall

	* Added fd_dirty() function and backend implementations.

2005-01-26 John Elliott

	* Version 0.3.3 released.

	* Fixed a silly transposition bug that was causing MFM sectors to be
	 written as FM, and vice versa. It wouldn't matter except that 
	 libdsk-1.1.2 and newer actually check FM/MFM in .DSK images.

2003-06-18 John Elliott

	* Version 0.3.1.1 released.

	* Configure script can now specify path to LibDsk (Philip Kendall)

2003-06-09 John Elliott

	* Version 0.3.1 released.

	* The default error function had the wrong prototype (Philip Kendall)

2002-11-18 John Elliott

	* Version 0.3.0 released.

	* For MacOS X compatibility, make fdc_dprintf() an explicitly 
	 registered callback rather than an undefined symbol (Fredrick Meunier)

2002-04-11 John Elliott

	* Version 0.2.0 released.

	* Sync with LibDsk 0.9.0.

	* Add support for WRITE DELETED DATA / READ DELETED DATA.

	* Add API support for FM encoding and multitrack operation, though
	 no driver (except LibDsk -> Linux floppy) supports these.

2002-04-06 John Elliott
	
	* Version 0.1.1 released.

	* Bugfixes for silly bugs in version 0.1.0 (Darren Salt, Philip Kendall)

	* Version 0.1.0 released.

	* Rewritten to conceal internal data structures from calling 
	 program, so that future versions can change without breaking 
	 binary compatibility. 


2002-02-26 John Elliott

	* Initial release.
